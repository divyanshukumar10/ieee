          <p>Most IEEE members are electrical and electronics engineer ,but organisation’s wide scope of interests have attracted people

in other disciplines as well.<br><br>An individual can join IEEE as student member,professional member or an associate member.<br><br><strong>Student Members:</strong> Student membership is available for a reduced fee to those who are enrolled in an accredited
institution of higher education as undergraduate or graduate students in technology or engineering.<br><br>
<strong>Graduate Student Members: </strong>Graduate Student Membership is discounted but members at this level have greater
privileges than do Student Members.<br><br><strong>Ordinary or professional Membership </strong> requires that the individual have graduated from a technology or engineering program of an appropriately accredited institution of higher education or have demonstrated professional competence in technology or engineering through at least six years of professional work experience.</p><p><strong>An associate membership</strong> is available to an individual whose area of expertise falls outside the scope of the
IEEE or who does not, at the time of enrollment, meet all the requirements for full membership. Students and Associates have all the privileges of members, except the right to vote and hold certain offices.</p><p><strong>Society Affiliates:</strong> Some IEEE Societies also allow a person who is not an IEEE member to become a Society Affiliate of a particular Society within the IEEE, which allows a limited form of participation in the work of a particular IEEE Society.</p><p><strong>Senior Members: </strong>Upon meeting certain requirements, a professional member can apply for Senior Membership, which is the highest level of recognition that a professional member can directly apply for. Applicants for Senior Member must have at least three letters of recommendation from Senior, Fellow, or <strong>Honorary members</strong> and fulfill other rigorous requirements of education, achievement, remarkable contribution, and experience in the field. The Senior Members are a selected group, and certain IEEE officer positions are available only to Senior (and Fellow) Members. Senior Membership is also one of the requirements for those who are nominated and elevated to the grade IEEE Fellow, a distinctive honor.</p>
<p><strong>Fellow Members: </strong>The Fellow grade of membership is the highest level of membership, and cannot be applied for
directly by the member – instead the candidate must be nominated by others. This grade of membership is conferred by the IEEE Board of Directors in recognition of a high level of demonstrated extraordinary accomplishment.</p><p> <strong>Honorary Members: </strong>Individuals who are not IEEE members but have demonstrated exceptional contributions, such as
being a recipient of an IEEE Medal of Honor, may receive Honorary Membership from the IEEE Board of Directors.</p>
